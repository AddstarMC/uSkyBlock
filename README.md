# uSkyBlock

This is a continually updated and custom version of Talabrek's Ultimate SkyBlock plugin, which he has decided to stop supporting.

## License

TL;DR - This is licensed under GPLv3

### Explanation / History
Originally the uSkyBlock was a continuation of the skySMP plugin, which was licensed under GPLv3
(see http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/skysmp/).

Unfortunately, Talabrek didn't seem to be aware of what software-licensing means, and claimed that his uSkyBlock was his private property.

When he abandoned the project - and the community called for a disclosure of the source-code, Dev-Bukkit decided to pull his plugin from the repository, and Talabrek countered by simply not sharing neither source-code nor binary releases.

Even though this is in violation of the GPLv3 license - no-one really cares.

So even though Talabrek deserves all the credit in the world - for making such an awesome plugin, this continuation is going to continue without him.
